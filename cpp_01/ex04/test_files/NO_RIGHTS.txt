🐨 Koalas 🐨
are marsupials native to Australia, known for their distinctive fluffy ears and round noses.
These animals spend most of their lives in eucalyptus trees, which provide both their habitat and primary food source.
A koala has a specialized diet, eating mainly eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to many other animals but are detoxified by the
koala's unique digestive system.


Despite their sleepy demeanor, spending up to 18 hours a day resting,
koalas
are adept climbers and can leap between branches with ease.

Unfortunately, koala populations are threatened by habitat destruction,
disease, and climate change.

Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of the koala, an iconic Australian animal.
